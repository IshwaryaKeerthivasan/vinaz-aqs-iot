## Vishnu Ishwarya Narendran Adwitya Zahara - Air Quality System

The VINAZ-Air Quality System is the key to analyzing and enhancing indoor air quality. This smart IoT device does more than just detect air quality in a space; it forecasts the Air Quality Index (AQI) to keep you updated about your surroundings.

### Real-time Monitoring

VINAZ continually analyzes the air in your room and provides real-time information on critical air quality indicators.

### AQI Prediction

VINAZ estimates the AQI using complex algorithms, allowing you to anticipate changes in air quality and take appropriate action.

### Data Analytics

All sensor readings are safely saved as datasets in Google spreadsheets, allowing you to track air quality trends over time.

### Visual Insights

VINAZ makes it simple to view air quality data by generating aesthetically appealing graphs using the Microsoft Power BI software, making complex data accessible and actionable.

### Sensors Used

- ESP32
- Arduino UNO
- NOVA PM Sensor
- Optical Dust Sensor
- DHT11 Sensor
- MQ7 Sensor
- MQ135 Sensor
- OLED Display
- Buzzer

VINAZ was created during a 24-hour Hackathon conducted by IEEE Bangalore Section-Level at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Mysore Campus, as a consequence of creativity and dedication to improving indoor air quality. With the VINAZ-Air Quality System, you can make educated decisions about your living environment and move toward a better, safer environment.
